# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts


```
my test
This code sets up the testing environment for a Solidity smart contract called "SaveERC20". Let's break it down:

1. Imports:
   - Utility functions from Hardhat and Chai for testing.
   - The `ethers` library for interacting with Ethereum.

2. `describe` block:
   - Starts a test suite for the "SaveERC20" contract.

3. Fixtures:
   Two fixtures are defined:

   a. `deployToken()`:
   - Gets two signers (accounts) from Hardhat.
   - Deploys an ERC20 token contract named "Web3CXI".
   - Returns the deployed token.

   b. `deploySaveERC20()`:
   - Gets two signers.
   - Uses `loadFixture(deployToken)` to deploy the ERC20 token.
   - Deploys the "SaveERC20" contract, passing the token address.
   - Returns the deployed contracts and signers.

Fixtures in Hardhat tests are used to set up a common state for multiple tests. The `loadFixture` function runs the setup once, takes a snapshot, and resets to that snapshot for each test, improving efficiency.

These fixtures prepare the testing environment by deploying necessary contracts and providing access to accounts, allowing individual tests to start from a clean, consistent state.
